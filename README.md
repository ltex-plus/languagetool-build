# Unofficial builds of LanguageTool

This repository provides unofficial builds of [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool) used for [LT<sub>E</sub>X+ LS](https://github.com/ltex-plus/ltex-ls-plus). The builds are saved as [releases](https://github.com/ltex-plus/languagetool-build/releases).

Once LanguageTool publishes a new release of LanguageTool, Dependabot tries to build the new version of LanguageTool. If this is successful, a new release in this repository is created automatically.
